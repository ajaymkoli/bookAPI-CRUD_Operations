# Book Management System

A simple, full-stack application for managing a list of books.

## üìö Project Overview

This project is a RESTful API and a front-end user interface that work together to perform **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of books. The back-end is built with **Node.js** and the **Express** framework, while the front-end uses plain **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The data is stored in memory, making it an excellent starting point for understanding how client-server applications function.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Create**: Add new books to the list via a simple form.
- **Read**: View all books in a formatted list on the front page.
- **Update**: Edit the title and author of an existing book.
- **Delete**: Remove a book from the list with a single click.
- **Responsive UI**: A basic but functional user interface that can be used directly without a separate API testing tool.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is structured to separate back-end logic from front-end assets.

## üìù API Endpoints

The back-end API provides the following endpoints:
